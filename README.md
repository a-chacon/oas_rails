# üìÉOpen API Specification For Rails

OasRails is a Rails engine for generating **automatic interactive documentation for your Rails APIs**. It generates an **OAS 3.1** document and displays it using **[RapiDoc](https://rapidocweb.com)**.

It relies on the [OasCore](https://github.com/a-chacon/oas_core) gem.

### üöÄ Demo App

## Related Projects

- **[ApiPie](https://github.com/Apipie/apipie-rails)**: Doesn't support OAS 3.1, requires learning a DSL, lacks a nice UI
- **[swagger_yard-rails](https://github.com/livingsocial/swagger_yard-rails)**: Seems abandoned, but serves as inspiration
- **[Rswag](https://github.com/rswag/rswag)**: Not automatic, depends on RSpec; Many developers now use Minitest as it's the default test framework
- **[grape-swagger](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape-swagger)**: Requires Grape
- **[rspec_api_documentation](https://github.com/zipmark/rspec_api_documentation)**: Requires RSpec and a command to generate the docs

## What Sets OasRails Apart?

- **Dynamic**: No command required to generate docs
- **Simple**: Complement default documentation with a few comments; no need to learn a complex DSL
- **Pure Ruby on Rails APIs**: No additional frameworks needed (e.g., Grape, RSpec)

## üìΩÔ∏è Motivation

After experiencing the interactive documentation in Python's fast-api framework, I sought similar functionality in Ruby on Rails. Unable to find a suitable solution, I [asked on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71947018/is-there-a-way-to-generate-an-interactive-documentation-for-rails-apis) years ago. Now, with some free time while freelancing as an API developer, I decided to build my own tool.

**Note: This is not yet a production-ready solution. The code may be rough and behave unexpectedly, but I am actively working on improving it. If you like the idea, please consider contributing to its development.**

The goal is to minimize the effort required to create comprehensive documentation. By following REST principles in Rails, we believe this is achievable. You can enhance the documentation using [Yard](https://yardoc.org/) tags.
