# OasRails Documentation

> This is the book with the documentation for configure and usage OasRails engine.

# Introduction

OasRails is a Rails engine that automatically generates OpenAPI 3.1 documentation from YARD comments in your Rails app, rendered with RapiDoc for interactive exploration.

### Key Features

- 🚀 **Automatic OAS 3.1 Generation**: OasRails scans your Rails application and generates OpenAPI specifications automatically.

- 📝 **YARD-Powered Documentation**: Use YARD tags in your endpoint comments to add descriptions, parameters, and examples—no need to learn a new DSL or use a specific framework (like Grape or RSpec).

- 🎨 **Interactive API Explorer**: Visualize and test your APIs in real-time with a polished UI powered by RapiDoc. If you prefer another UI, you can easily replace RapiDoc with alternatives like Swagger UI or ReDoc.

# Installation

1. Add this line to your Rails application's Gemfile:

   ```ruby
   gem "oas_rails"`
   ```

2. Execute:

   ```bash
   bundle
   ```

3. Mount the engine in your config/routes.rb file

   ```ruby
   mount OasRails::Engine => '/docs'
   ```

You'll now have **basic documentation** based on your routes and automatically gathered information at `localhost:3000/docs`. To enhance it, create an initializer file and add [Yard](https://yardoc.org/) tags to your controller methods.


# Configuration

To configure OasRails, **you MUST create an initializer file** including all your settings. The first step is to create your initializer file, which you can easily do with:

```bash
rails generate oas_rails:config
```

Then fill it with your data. Below are the available configuration options:

### Basic Information about the API

- `config.info.title`: The title of your API documentation.

- `config.info.summary`: A brief summary of your API.

- `config.info.description`: A detailed description of your API. This can include markdown formatting and will be displayed prominently in your documentation.

- `config.info.contact.name`: The name of the contact person or organization.

- `config.info.contact.email`: The contact email address.

- `config.info.contact.url`: The URL for more information or support.

### Servers Information

- `config.servers`: An array of server objects, each containing `url` and `description` keys. For more details, refer to the [OpenAPI Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html#server-object).

### Tag Information

- `config.tags`: An array of tag objects, each containing `name` and `description` keys. For more details, refer to the [OpenAPI Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html#tag-object).

### Optional Settings

- `config.include_mode`: Determines the mode for including operations. The default value is `all`, which means it will include all route operations under the `api_path`, whether documented or not. Other possible values:
  - `:with_tags`: Includes in your OAS only the operations with at least one tag. Example:

    Not included:

    ```ruby
    def update
    end
    ```

    Included:

    ```ruby
    # @summary Return all Books
    def index
    end
    ```

  - `:explicit`: Includes in your OAS only the operations tagged with `@oas_include`. Example:

    Not included:

    ```ruby
    def update
    end
    ```

    Included:

    ```ruby
    # @oas_include
    def index
    end
    ```

- `config.api_path`: Sets the API path if your API is under a different namespace than the root. This is important to configure if you have the `include_mode` set to `all` because it will include all routes of your app in the final OAS. For example, if your app has additional routes and your API is under the namespace `/api`, set this configuration as follows:

  ```ruby
  config.api_path = "/api"
  ```

- `config.ignored_actions`: Defines an array of controller or controller#action pairs. You do not need to prepend the `api_path`. This is useful when you want to include all routes except a few specific actions or when an external engine (e.g., Devise) adds routes to your API.

- `config.default_tags_from`: Determines the source of default tags for operations. Can be set to `:namespace` or `:controller`. The first option means that if your endpoint is in the route `/users/:id`, it will be tagged with `Users`. If set to `controller`, the tag will be `UsersController`.

- `config.autodiscover_request_body`: Automatically detects request bodies for create/update methods. Default is `true`.
- `config.autodiscover_responses`: Automatically detects responses from controller renders. Default is `true`.
- `config.http_verbs`: Defaults to `[:get, :post, :put, :patch, :delete]`
- `config.use_model_names`: Use model names when possible, defaults to `false`

### Authentication Settings

- `config.authenticate_all_routes_by_default`: Determines whether to authenticate all routes by default. Default is `true`.

- `config.security_schema`: The default security schema used for authentication. Choose from the following predefined options:
  - `:api_key_cookie`: API key passed via HTTP cookie.
  - `:api_key_header`: API key passed via HTTP header.
  - `:api_key_query`: API key passed via URL query parameter.
  - `:basic`: HTTP Basic Authentication.
  - `:bearer`: Bearer token (generic).
  - `:bearer_jwt`: Bearer token formatted as a JWT (JSON Web Token).
  - `:mutual_tls`: Mutual TLS authentication (mTLS).

- `config.security_schemas`: Custom security schemas. Follow the [OpenAPI Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html#security-scheme-object) for defining these schemas.

### Default Errors

- **`config.set_default_responses`**: Determines whether to add default error responses to endpoints. Default is `true`.

- **`config.possible_default_responses`**: An array of possible default error responses. Some responses are added conditionally based on the endpoint (e.g., `:not_found` only applies to `show`, `update`, or `delete` actions).  
  **Default**: `[:not_found, :unauthorized, :forbidden, :internal_server_error, :unprocessable_entity]`  
  **Allowed Values**: Symbols representing HTTP status codes from the list:  
  `[:not_found, :unauthorized, :forbidden, :internal_server_error, :unprocessable_entity]`

- **`config.response_body_of_default`**: The response body template for default error responses. Must be a string representing a hash, similar to those used in request body tags.  
  **Default**: `"Hash{ message: String }"`

- **`config.response_body_of_{code symbol}`**: Customizes the response body for specific error responses. Must be a string representing a hash, similar to `response_body_of_default`. If not specified, it defaults to the value of `response_body_of_default`.  

  **Examples**:

  ```ruby
  # Customize the response body for "unprocessable_entity" errors
  config.response_body_of_unprocessable_entity = "Hash{ errors: Array<String> }"

  # Customize the response body for "forbidden" errors
  config.response_body_of_forbidden = "Hash{ code: Integer, message: String }"
  ```

### Project License

- `config.info.license.name`: The title name of your project's license. Default: GPL 3.0

- `config.info.license.url`: The URL to the full license text. Default: <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html#license-text>


# Enabling CORS for Interactive Documentation

By default, OasRails uses **RapiDoc** as the frontend for interactive API documentation. However, you can customize this to use other tools like Swagger UI or ReDoc if needed.

To test endpoints interactively using RapiDoc (or your chosen frontend), you must enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in your Rails application. Follow these steps:

1. **Add the `rack-cors` gem** to your `Gemfile` (Or uncomment):

   ```ruby
   gem 'rack-cors'
   ```

2. **Run `bundle install`** to install the gem.

3. **Configure CORS** in `config/initializers/cors.rb` (create the file if it doesn't exist):

   ```ruby
   Rails.application.config.middleware.insert_before 0, Rack::Cors do
     allow do
       origins '*'  # For development, allow all origins. Restrict this in production.
       resource '*',
         headers: :any,
         methods: [:get, :post, :put, :patch, :delete, :options, :head],
         credentials: false  # Set to `true` if using cookies or authentication headers.
     end
   end
   ```

4. **Restart your Rails server** for the changes to take effect.

This will allow RapiDoc to make requests to your API endpoints from the browser.


# Securing the OasRails Engine

To secure the OasRails engine, which exposes an endpoint for showing the OAS definition, you can configure authentication to ensure that only authorized users have access. Here are a few methods to achieve this:

### 1. Using Basic Authentication

Use basic authentication to protect the OasRails endpoint. You can set this up in an initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/oas_rails.rb
OasRails::Engine.middleware.use(Rack::Auth::Basic) do |username, password|
  ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.secure_compare(Rails.application.credentials.oas_rails_username, username) &
    ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.secure_compare(Rails.application.credentials.oas_rails_password, password)
end
```

### 2. Using Devise's `authenticate` Helper

You can use Devise's `authenticate` helper to restrict access to the OasRails endpoint. For example, you can allow only admin users to access the endpoint:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
# ...
authenticate :user, ->(user) { user.admin? } do
  mount OasRails::Engine, at: '/docs'
end
```

### 3. Custom Authentication

To support custom authentication, you can extend the OasRails' ApplicationController using a hook. This allows you to add custom before actions to check for specific user permissions:

```ruby
# config/initializers/oas_rails.rb

ActiveSupport.on_load(:oas_rails_application_controller) do
  # context here is OasRails::ApplicationController

  before_action do
    raise ActionController::RoutingError.new('Not Found') unless current_user&.admin?
  end

  def current_user
    # Load the current user
    User.find(session[:user_id]) # Adjust according to your authentication logic
  end
end
```


# Customizing the View

The OasRails engine provides an easy way to display your OpenAPI Specification (OAS) within your Rails application. By default, it includes an `index` view in the `OasRailsController` that displays [RapiDoc](https://rapidocweb.com/) through a CDN with default configurations. You can easily override this view to replace RapiDoc entirely or configure it differently.

### Available configurations

#### Changing the UI Theme

You can customize the appearance of the OAS documentation UI by setting the `config.rapidoc_theme` option in the initializer file. The default theme is `"rails"`, but you can choose from the following predefined themes:

- **dark**: Dark background with light text.
- **light**: Light background with dark text.
- **night**: Dark theme with a blueish tint.
- **mud**: Dark theme with brownish tones.
- **coffee**: Dark theme with warm brown tones.
- **forest**: Dark theme with greenish tones.
- **olive**: Dark theme with olive tones.
- **outerspace**: Dark theme with a space-like feel.
- **ebony**: Dark theme with deep blue tones.
- **snow**: Light theme with a clean white background.
- **green**: Light theme with green accents.
- **blue**: Light theme with blue accents.
- **beige**: Light theme with a beige background.
- **graynav**: Light theme with a gray navigation bar.
- **purplenav**: Light theme with a purple navigation bar.
- **lightgraynav**: Light theme with a light gray navigation bar.
- **darkbluenav**: Light theme with a dark blue navigation bar.
- **rails**: Default theme with Rails-inspired colors (red accents).

#### How to Configure the Theme

To change the theme, add the following line to your `config/initializers/oas_rails.rb` file:

```ruby
OasRails.configure do |config|
  config.rapidoc_theme = "dark" # Replace "dark" with your preferred theme name
end
```

Any other modification will require that you overwrite the index view explained in the next steps.

### Overriding the `index` View

To override the `index` view provided by the OasRails engine, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Override View File**: In your host application, create a new file at the path `app/views/oas_rails/oas_rails/index.html.erb`. If the directories do not exist, you will need to create them.

2. **Customize the View**: Open the newly created `index.html.erb` file and add your custom HTML and ERB code to display the OAS as desired. You can refer to the source code of this project for guidance.

#### Using the Custom View

Once the custom view file is in place, Rails will automatically use it instead of the view provided by the OasRails engine. This allows you to fully customize the presentation of the OAS without modifying the engine's code.


# Tags

In addition to the information provided in the initializer file and the data that can be extracted from the routes and methods automatically, it is essential to document your API in the following way. The documentation is created **with the help of YARD**, so the methods are documented with **comment tags**.

### Documenting Your Endpoints

Almost every tag description in an OAS file supports **markdown formatting** (e.g., bold, italics, lists, links) for better readability in the generated documentation. Additionally, **multi-line descriptions** are supported. When using multi-line descriptions, ensure the content is indented at least one space more than the tag itself to maintain proper formatting.

For example:

```ruby
  # @request_body_example Simple User [Hash]
  #   {
  #     user: {
  #       name: "Oas",
  #       email: "oas@test.com",
  #       password: "Test12345"
  #     }
  #   }
```

You can use these tags in your controller methods to enhance the automatically generated documentation. Remember to use markdown formatting in your descriptions for better readability in the generated OAS document.


# @summary

**Structure**: `@summary text`

Used to add a summary to the endpoint. It replaces the default summary/title of the endpoint.

**Example**:

`# @summary This endpoint creates a User`

```
# @summary This endpoint
#   creates a User
```


# @parameter

**Structure**: `@parameter name(position) [type] text`

Represents a parameter for the endpoint. The position can be: `header`, `path`, `cookie`, or `query`. The type should be a valid Ruby class: `String`, `Integer`, `Array<String>`, etc. Add a `!` before the class to indicate a required parameter.

**Examples**:
`# @parameter page(query) [Integer] The page number.`
`# @parameter slug(path) [!String] Slug of the Project.`


# @request_body

**Structure**: `@request_body text [type<structure>]`

Documents the request body needed by the endpoint. The structure is optional if you provide a valid Active Record class. Use `!` to indicate a required request body.

**One line example**:

`# @request_body The user to be created [!User]`

`# @request_body The user to be created [User]`

**Multi-line example**:

```ruby
  # @request_body User to be created
  #   [
  #     !Hash{
  #       user: Hash{
  #         name: String,
  #         email: String,
  #         age: Integer,
  #         cars: Array<
  #           Hash{
  #             identifier: String
  #           }
  #         >
  #       }
  #     }
  #   ]
```


# @request_body_example

**Structure**: `@request_body_example text [type] structure`

Adds examples to the provided request body.

**One line example**:

`# @request_body_example A complete User. [Hash] {user: {name: 'Luis', age: 30, password: 'MyWeakPassword123'}}`

**Multi-line example**:

```ruby
  # @request_body_example basic user [Hash]
  #   {
  #     user: {
  #       name: "Oas",
  #       email: "oas@test.com",
  #       password: "Test12345"
  #     }
  #   }
```


# @response

**Structure**: `@response text(code) [type<structure>]`

Documents the responses of the endpoint and overrides the default responses found by the engine.

**One line example**:

`# @response User not found by the provided Id(404) [Hash{success: Boolean, message: String}]`

`# @response Validation errors(422) [Hash{success: Boolean, errors: Array<Hash{field: String, type: String, detail: Array<String>}>}]`

**Multi-line example**:

```ruby
  # @response A test response from an Issue(405)
  #   [
  #     Hash{
  #       message: String,
  #       data: Hash{
  #         availabilities: Array<String>,
  #         dates: Array<Date>
  #       }
  #     }
  #   ]
```


# @response_example

**Structure**: `@response_example text(code) [String Hash]`

Documents response examples of the endpoint associated to a response code.

**One line example**:

`# @response_example Invalida Email(422) [{success: "false", errors: [{field: "email", type: "email", detail: ["Invalid email"]}] }]`

`# @response_example Id not exists (404) [{success: "false", message: "Nothing found with the provided ID." }]`

**Multi-line example**:

```ruby
  # @response_example Another 405 Error (405) [Hash]
  #   {
  #     message: "another",
  #     data: {
  #       availabilities: [
  #         "three"
  #       ],
  #       dates: []
  #     }
  #   }
```


# @tag

**Structure**: `@tag text`

Tags your endpoints. You can complete the tag documentation in the initializer file by defining these tags beforehand. It's not necessary for the tag to exist in your initializer file before use.

**Example**:
`# @tag Users`


# @no_auth

**Structure**: `@no_auth`

This tag will remove any security requirement from the endpoint. Useful when most of your endpoints require authentication and only a few do not.(Ex: Login, Registration...)

**Example**:
`# @no_auth`


# @auth

**Structure**: `@auth [types]`

This tag will set which security mechanisms can be used for the endpoint. The security mechanisms MUST be defined previously in the initializer file.

**Example**:
`# @auth [bearer, basic]`


# @oas_include

Use this tag to explicitly include endpoints in the final OpenAPI Specification (OAS) file **when `include_mode` is set to `:explicit`**. Only endpoints annotated with `@oas_include` will be included.

## Usage

Add the `@oas_include` tag as a comment above the endpoint you want to document. For example:

### Endpoint Not Included (Default Behavior)

```ruby
def update
end
```

### Endpoint Included (With `@oas_include`)

```ruby
# @oas_include
def index
end
```


# Examples

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_user, only: %i[show update destroy]

  # @summary Returns a list of Users.
  #
  # @parameter offset(query) [Integer]  Used for pagination of response data (default: 25 items per response). Specifies the offset of the next block of data to receive.
  # @parameter status(query) [Array<String>]   Filter by status. (e.g. status[]=inactive&status[]=deleted).
  # @parameter X-front(header) [String] Header for identify the front.
  def index
    @users = User.all
  end

  # @summary Get a user by id.
  # @auth [bearer]
  #
  # This method show a User by ID. The id must exist of other way it will be returning a **`404`**.
  #
  # @parameter id(path) [Integer] Used for identify the user.
  # @response Requested User(200) [Hash] {user: {name: String, email: String, created_at: DateTime }}
  # @response User not found by the provided Id(404) [Hash] {success: Boolean, message: String}
  # @response You don't have the right permission for access to this resource(403) [Hash] {success: Boolean, message: String}
  def show
    render json: @user
  end

  # @summary Create a User
  # @no_auth
  #
  # @request_body The user to be created. At least include an `email`. [!User]
  # @request_body_example basic user [Hash] {user: {name: "Luis", email: "luis@gmail.ocom"}}
  def create
    @user = User.new(user_params)

    if @user.save
      render json: @user, status: :created
    else
      render json: { success: false, errors: @user.errors }, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  # A `user` can be updated with this method
  # - There is no option
  # - It must work
  # @tags users, update
  # @request_body User to be created [!Hash{user: { name: String, email: !String, age: Integer, available_dates: Array<Date>}}]
  # @request_body_example Update user [Hash] {user: {name: "Luis", email: "luis@gmail.com"}}
  # @request_body_example Complete User [Hash] {user: {name: "Luis", email: "luis@gmail.com", age: 21}}
  def update
    if @user.update(user_params)
      render json: @user
    else
      render json: @user.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  # @summary Delete a User
  # Delete a user and his associated data.
  def destroy
    @user.destroy!
    redirect_to users_url, notice: 'User was successfully destroyed.', status: :see_other
  end

  private

  # Use callbacks to share common setup or constraints between actions.
  def set_user
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
  end

  # Only allow a list of trusted parameters through.
  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email)
  end
end
```




# LLMs Documentation (llms.txt)

OasRails generates `.txt` files optimized for AI integration:

- [llms.txt](/llms.txt): Provides the basics to understand the structure and functionality of OasRails. (Work in progress)
- [llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt): Offers a full description of how to use OasRails and document endpoints. (**Currently recommended**)

## How It Works (in 3 Steps)

### 1. Choose the File

OasRails generates `.txt` files optimized for AI tools.

### 2. Load It Into Your Tool

You can load these files into any AI tool or editor that supports external context. For this example, I used Cursor. **This is not a tool I recommend** because it is closed-source, but it worked for the example.

<video controls>
  <source src="https://a-chacon.com/assets/images/cursor+oasrails.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

### 3. Ask Questions Naturally

Examples of questions you can ask:

- *"How to document JWT authentication in OasRails?"*  
- *"Document the endpoint..."*  
- *"Add examples of possible request bodies for the create method."*
